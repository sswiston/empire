\usage{
continue_MCMC(mcmc, iterations, moves_per_iteration = 1, thinning = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{mcmc}{The ellipseMCMC object to run}

\item{iterations}{The number of iterations to run the analysis. None of these iterations will be used as burnin, and hyperparameters will not be further tuned.}

\item{moves_per_iteration}{The number of moves per iteration (total number of proposals for one iteration). The default value is 1.}

\item{thinning}{How often the mcmc output is recorded, for example (thinning=10) will record every 10 generations. The default value is 1.}
