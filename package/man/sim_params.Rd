\arguments{
\item{c_val}{An object of class "vector" containing any number of numeric elements indicating the values associated with different concentric circles relative to the size of the original circle. The default value includes 4 concentric circles: 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5.}

\item{h_val}{An object of class "vector" containing any number of numeric elements indicating the values associated with different direction lines in radians. The default value includes 8 direction lines: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi, 5pi/4, 3pi/2, and 7pi/4.}

\item{rho_m}{An object of class "vector" containing two numeric elements: the prior probability of cladogenetic mode 1 (sympatry) and the prior probability of cladogenetic mode 2 (allopatry). The default value assigns probability 0.5 to both modes.}

\item{rho_c}{An object of class "vector" containing any number of numeric elements (equal to the length of c_val) corresponding to the prior probabilities of different concentric circle assignments. The default value assigns probability 0.25 to each of 4 concentric circles.}

\item{rho_h}{An object of class "vector" containing any number of numeric elements (equal to the length of h_val) corresponding to the prior probabilities of different direction line assignments. The default value assigns probability 0.125 to each of 8 direction lines.}

\item{sigma_r}{An object of class "numeric" containing the evolutionary rate of the continuous character 'r', which helps define an ellipse's "oblongness". If left blank, the default behavior will draw a value from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1.}

\item{sigma_s}{An object of class "numeric" containing the evolutionary rate of the continuous character 's', which helps define an ellipse's "oblongness". If left blank, the default behavior will draw a value from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1.}

\item{sigma_a}{An object of class "numeric" containing the evolutionary rate of the continuous character 'a', which helps define an ellipse's size. If left blank, the default behavior will draw a value from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1.}

\item{alpha}{An object of class "numeric" containing the log size of the new ellipse (daughter 2) under the sympatric cladogenetic scenario. Default value is -3.}

\item{root_r}{An object of class "numeric" containing the root value for the 'r' character. If left blank, the default behavior will draw a value from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.}

\item{root_s}{An object of class "numeric" containing the root value for the 's' character. If left blank, the default behavior will draw a value from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.}

\item{root_a}{An object of class "numeric" containing the root value for the 'a' character. If left blank, the default behavior will draw a value from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.}

\item{sigma_x}{An object of class "numeric" containing the evolutionary rate of the continuous character 'x', which helps define an ellipse's center location. If left blank, the default behavior will draw a value from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1.}

\item{sigma_y}{An object of class "numeric" containing the evolutionary rate of the continuous character 'y', which helps define an ellipse's center location. If left blank, the default behavior will draw a value from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1.}

\item{root_x}{An object of class "numeric" containing the root value for the 'x' character. If left blank, the default behavior will draw a value from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.}

\item{root_y}{An object of class "numeric" containing the root value for the 'y' character. If left blank, the default behavior will draw a value from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.}

\item{z}{An object of class "numeric" containing the height of the tilt vector for the ellipses. This model parameter does not evolve over time, and is only used in the interpretation of rates of 'r' and 's'. The default value will suffice for most analyses. The default value is 10.}

\item{mu}{An object of class "numeric" containing the central tendancy of the continuous character 'a', which helps define an ellipse's size. If left blank, the default behavior will draw a value from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.}

\item{kappa}{An object of class "numeric" containing the rate of mean reversion of the continuous character 'a', which helps define an ellipse's size. If left blank, the default behavior will draw a value from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1.}
