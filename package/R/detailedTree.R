# detailedTree object -----------------------------------------------------

#' @title detailedTree object
#' @description This class stores an object of class "phylo" and generates other data relevant to the phylogeny
#' @details The "detailedTree" object stores a tree object of class "phylo", typically from the "ape" package, alongside other important information about its nodes, branches, and structure. This information is useful when implementing phylogenetic analyses, like the ellipse evolution analysis.
#' @field tree An object of class "phylo", typically from the "ape" package. This must be an ultrametric, binary tree.
#' @field n_tips An integer giving the number of tips in the tree
#' @field n_nodes An integer giving the number of nodes in the tree, including root and tips
#' @field root_idx An integer giving the index of the root node, typically 1 greater than the number of tips
#' @field edges An object of class "data.frame" listing all edges with start, end, and length
#' @field nodes An object of class "data.frame" listing all nodes with parent, right child, and left child
#' @field descendants An object of class "matrix" indicating whether a node (column) is a descendant of another node (row) using binary representation (0 = non-descendant, 1 = descendant)
#' @field tip_descendants An object of class "matrix" indicating whether a tip (column) is a descendant of another node (row) using binary representation (0 = non-descendant, 1 = descendant), where all tips are descendants of themselves
#' @field phy_matrix An object of class "matrix" giving the phylogenetic variance-covariance matrix indicated by the tree structure (not scaled by evolutionary rates)
#' @field inv_matrix An object of class "matrix" giving the inverse of the phylogenetic variance-covariance matrix indicated by the tree structure (not scaled by evolutionary rates)
#' @field full_matrix An object of class "matrix" giving the full phylogenetic variance-covariance matrix indicated by the tree structure, including internal nodes (not scaled by evolutionary rates)
